# Burger
This application is a single page, full stack web app, in which a menu of available hamburgers is presented.

User can eat any of the burgers on the menu in the “Burgers Available To Eat” section. “Eating” is accomplished by clicking the “Devour It!” button below the burger’s name. When a burger has been eaten, it is moved to the “Burgers That Have Been Eaten” list.

The user is also able to Add A Burger. To do this, the user simply types in a free-form text description in the “Add A Burger” section of the App. The new burger will then appear in the “Burgers Available To Eat” section. The user may then “eat” this new burger.
